## Code Architecture

This is an educational project for learning AI concepts, organized as numbered lessons with a consistent structure.

### Lessons (Authoring Rules)

- **All lesson content lives in `src/`.** Add new lessons and update existing lesson modules only under `src/`.
- Treat `notes/` as reference material (templates + planning). Do not place lesson implementations in `notes/`.
- **Start every new lesson from the template**: copy `notes/lesson_template.py` into `src/` and edit it.
- **Follow the canonical docs**:
  - `notes/LESSON_TEMPLATE.md` / `notes/lesson_template.py` for structure, CLI, doctests, and quality gates
  - `notes/lesson_plan.md` for the curriculum order, prerequisites, and lesson scope

### Project Structure
- `src/`: Lesson modules (e.g., `src/001_intro.py`) — the curriculum lives here.
- `notes/`: Templates, supporting material, and the lesson plan (not lesson implementations).
- Each lesson is self-contained and runnable with `python path/to/lesson.py` (prefer `uv run python ...`).

### Lesson Template Structure

All lessons must follow the structure and conventions in:
- `notes/lesson_template.py` (authoritative runnable template)
- `notes/LESSON_TEMPLATE.md` (what to edit + quality gates)
- `notes/lesson_plan.md` (curriculum sequence)

### Narrative Guidance

Anchor lessons in practical AI work:
- Data collection and preprocessing
- Training and evaluation
- Serving/inference and monitoring
- Reliability, performance, and correctness

### Key Development Practices
- All code must pass `mypy --strict`
- Use numpy docstring convention
- Include comprehensive doctests in all implementations
- Each module should be runnable standalone with meaningful output
- Always include complexity analysis (time and space)
- Connect concepts to the narrative scenarios

### Testing Strategy
- Doctests are the primary testing method (automatically run by pytest)
- Tests should demonstrate usage and edge cases
- Performance timing in main() functions helps understand complexity
- Use minimal sleeps and ellipses for concurrency tests

### Classes with fields

**Classes with fields** — `NamedTuple`, dataclasses — document every field in
an `Attributes` section:

```python
@dataclass(frozen=True, slots=True)
class Args:
    """Parsed command-line arguments.

    Attributes
    ----------
    seed : int
        Seed applied to every random source before the lesson runs.
    artifact_dir : Path
        Directory the lesson writes figures and checkpoints to.
    """
```

A type says how a field is shaped, not what it holds. Describing each one
keeps that meaning next to the code, and anything that renders the class —
autodoc, a REPL, an editor tooltip — has a description to show instead of a
bare name.

### Doctests

**All functions and methods MUST have working doctests.** Doctests serve as both documentation and tests.

**CRITICAL RULES:**
- Doctests MUST actually execute - never comment out function calls or similar
- Doctests MUST NOT be converted to `.. code-block::` as a workaround (code-blocks don't run)
- If you cannot create a working doctest, **STOP and ask for help**

**Available tools for doctests:**
- `doctest_namespace` fixtures: `tmp_path` (add more via `conftest.py`)
- Ellipsis for variable output: `# doctest: +ELLIPSIS`

**`# doctest: +SKIP` is NOT permitted** - it's just another workaround that doesn't test anything.

**When output varies, use ellipsis:**
```python
>>> import time
>>> time.time()  # doctest: +ELLIPSIS
1...
```

**For async code:**
```python
>>> import asyncio
>>> async def example():
...     return "result"
>>> asyncio.run(example())
'result'
```

## Git Commit Standards

Format commit messages as:

```
Scope(type[detail]): concise description

why: Explanation of necessity or impact.

what:
- Specific technical changes made
- Focused on a single topic
```

The blank line between the `why:` block and the `what:` block is
optional — useful when the `why:` body runs to multiple lines and the
two sections benefit from visual separation.

Common commit types:

- **feat**: New features or enhancements
- **fix**: Bug fixes
- **refactor**: Code restructuring without functional change
- **docs**: Documentation updates
- **chore**: Maintenance (dependencies, tooling, config)
- **test**: Test-related updates
- **style**: Code style and formatting
- **py(deps)**: Dependencies
- **py(deps[dev])**: Dev Dependencies
- **ai(rules[AGENTS])**: AI rule updates
- **ai(claude[rules])**: Claude Code rules (CLAUDE.md)

Subjects are plain English. Never put curriculum codes or other
repo-internal shorthand in the subject line — a reader of
`git log --oneline` should understand every title cold.

Example:

```
docs(README[setup]): Document the uv-based install

why: New clones failed on the old pip instructions.

what:
- Replace pip commands with uv equivalents
- Note the supported Python floor
```

For multi-line commits, use heredoc to preserve formatting:

```bash
git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
Scope(type[detail]): concise description

why: Explanation of the change.

what:
- First change
- Second change
EOF
)"
```

Guidelines:

- Subject line at most 50 characters; body lines at most 72
- Imperative mood ("Add", "Fix" — not "Added", "Fixed")
- One topic per commit; blank line between subject and body
- Mark breaking changes with `BREAKING:`

## Documentation Standards

### Code blocks are paste-and-run units

One command per triple-backtick block, so pasting a block runs exactly
one intended action. Don't blur multiple commands annotated by comments
into the same block — explanations belong in prose above the block. A
multi-step sequence may share a block only when explicitly chained with
`;` / `; \` (the chain *is* the single action). Command menus are
per-command blocks with prose lead-ins, not tables.

## AI Slop Prevention

Treat AI slop as **review-hostile noise**, not as proof that text or
code is wrong. The goal is to maximize information density by removing
artifacts that make the repository harder to trust or navigate.

### The Anti-Slop Rubric

Before committing, audit all AI-assisted changes for these noise
patterns:

- **AI Signatures:** Remove "Generated by", footers, conversational
  filler ("Certainly!", "Here is..."), unexplained emojis (🤖, ✨), and
  AI-tool metadata.
- **Brittle References:** Avoid hard-coded line numbers, fragile
  file/test counts, dated "as of" claims, bare SHAs, and local
  absolute paths unless they are strict evidentiary artifacts (e.g.,
  benchmark logs).
- **Diff Narration:** Do not restate what moved, was renamed, or was
  removed in artifacts the downstream reader holds: code, docstrings,
  README, CHANGES, PR descriptions, or release notes. The diff and
  commit message already carry this history.
- **Branch-Internal Narrative:** Do not mention intermediate branch
  states, abandoned approaches, or "no longer" behavior unless users
  of a published release actually experienced the old state (**The
  Published-Release Test**).
- **Low-Value Scaffolding:** Remove ownerless TODOs (`TODO: revisit`),
  unused future-proofing, debug artifacts, and defensive wrappers that
  do not protect a currently reachable failure mode.
- **Prose Inflation:** Replace generic AI "tells" like *comprehensive,
  robust, seamless, production-ready, leverage, delve, tapestry,* and
  *best practices* with concrete descriptions of behavior,
  constraints, or trade-offs.
- **Coded Labels:** Write rules, options, and findings as plain
  imperatives. Don't tag them with codes like `[R1]`, `A1`, or
  `Option B` in artifacts a human reads — the reader shouldn't have to
  decode an index. Internal agent bookkeeping may use ids; shipped text
  may not.

### Durable Source Links

Link to a pinned revision, never to trunk. A pinned permalink is not a
brittle reference; an unlinked SHA dropped into prose is. `blob/main/…`
links rot silently — the file moves, lines shift, and the anchor lands
on unrelated code while still resolving.

- Prefer a release tag (`blob/v1.4.0/…`). Most durable, and it tells
  the reader which released version the claim held for.
- Otherwise use a 7-char commit ref (`blob/9a29b1a/…`) reachable from
  trunk. Use when there is no tag or the claim is about unreleased
  code. Never a PR-head SHA — it can be rebased or garbage-collected.
- Reserve `blob/main/…` for living documents meant to always show the
  latest state, such as a contributing guide.
- Line anchors (`#L120-L145`) are only safe on a pinned ref.

### Preservation & Context

**When unsure, leave the text in place and ask.** Subjective cleanup
must never be a reason to remove load-bearing rationale.

- **Preserve the "Why":** You MUST NOT delete comments that document
  invariants, protocol constraints, platform quirks, security
  boundaries, and upstream workarounds.
- **Evidence is Immune:** Preserve exact counts, dates, and SHAs when
  they serve as evidence in benchmark results, release notes, stack
  traces, or lockfiles.
- **Behavior Over Inventory:** A useful description explains what
  changed for the *system or user*; it does not provide an inventory
  of files or functions the diff already shows.

### The Published-Release Test

Long-running branches accumulate tactical decisions — renames,
refactors, attempts-then-reverts. When deciding what counts as
branch-internal, use trunk or the parent branch as the baseline — not
intermediate states inside the current branch. Ask:

> Did users of the most recently published release ever experience
> this old name, old behavior, or bug?

If the answer is **no**, it is branch-internal narrative. Move it to
the commit message and describe only the final state in the artifact.

**Keep in shipped artifacts:**

- Deprecations and migration guides for symbols that actually shipped.
- `### Fixes` entries for bugs that affected users of a published
  release.
- Comments explaining *why the current code looks this way*
  (invariants, platform quirks) that make sense to a reader who never
  saw the previous version.

### Cleanup in Hindsight

When applying these rules retroactively from inside a feature branch,
first establish scope by diffing against the parent branch (or trunk)
to identify which commits this branch actually introduced. Then:

- **In-branch commits:** Prompt the user with two options: `fixup!`
  commits with `git rebase --autosquash` to address each causal commit
  at its source, or a single cleanup commit at branch tip.
- **Trunk/Parent commits:** Default to leaving them alone. Act only on
  explicit user instruction. If the user opts in, fold the cleanup
  into a single commit at branch tip; do not rewrite shared history.
- **Scope guard:** If cleaning prior slop would touch a colleague's
  work or expand the branch beyond its stated goal, stay in lane:
  protect the current goal and leave prior slop alone.

### Change Discipline

- Make the smallest coherent change that solves the verified problem;
  keep unrelated cleanup out of it.
- Reuse an existing file, component, helper, API, or test before adding
  a new one. Modify in place when the change fits the file's
  responsibility.
- Keep new APIs private until a caller outside the module needs them.
- Add a file only for a durable boundary — a distinct responsibility,
  independent reuse, or splitting an oversized high-touch module — not
  for a single-use helper or a one-line re-export.

### Keep Instructions Lean

Treat this file like code and prune it.

- Delete a line whose removal would not cause a mistake.
- Move multi-step procedures into skills, path-specific rules into
  nested AGENTS.md files, and hard limits into hooks or CI.
- Keep only non-obvious, broadly applicable defaults here. Anything a
  reader can infer from the code, a manifest, or a linter does not
  belong.
